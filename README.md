# nfq-task
Customer service department system task made for a job interview.
## Setup

Considering you already downloaded the code you must follow these steps:


**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.


**Start the built-in web server**

Symfony's local web server works best.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve (-d)
```
